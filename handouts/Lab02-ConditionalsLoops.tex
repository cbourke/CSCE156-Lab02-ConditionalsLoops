\section*{Lab Objectives \& Topics}
Following the lab, you should be able to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Use if-then-else statements to control the logical flow of the program.
  \item Use switch-case statement to control the logical flow of the program.
  \item Use for/while loops to implement repetition statements in your program.
  \item Write complex programs that require conditional logical statements and or loops.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Conditionals \& Loops}

PHP provides standard control structures for conditionals and repetition.  Specifically, PHP provides the usual if-then-else statements and while, for, and do-while loops.  The syntax for these control structures should look familiar; some examples:

\begin{minted}{php}
if(condition1) {
  //DO SOMETHING
} else if(condition2) {
  //DO SOMETHING ELSE
} else {
  //OTHERWISE
}

for($i=0; $i<$n; $i++) {
  //DO SOMETHING
}

$i=0;
while($i<$n) {
  //DO SOMETHING
  $i++;
}

$i=0;
do{ 
  //DO SOMETHING
  $i++;
} while($i<$n);
\end{minted}

In addition, PHP provides a foreach-loop for iterating over elements in 
an array.  This is not just for convenience: in PHP arrays are associative 
so they are not necessarily indexed 0 thru n - 1; arrays may not even 
be indexed with integers!  Instead, array should be considered to be a
collection of key-value pairs.  The following examples illustrate the 
foreach loop's usage.

\begin{minted}{php}
foreach($array as $value) {
  print "$value \n";
}

foreach($array as $key => $value) {
  print "The key $key maps to the value $value\n";
}
\end{minted}

\section*{Activities}

\subsection*{Sum of Natural Numbers}

Natural numbers are the usual counting numbers; 1, 2, 3, \ldots.  In 
this exercise you will write several loops to compute the sum of 
natural numbers 1 thru $n$ where $n$ is read from the command line.  
You will also write a foreach loop to iterate over an array and 
process data.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Open the \mintinline{text}{natural.php} source file.  The code 
	to read in $n$ has already been provided for you.  An array mapping 
	integer values 1 thru 10 to text values has also been created for you.
  \item Write a for-loop and a while-loop to compute the sum of natural 
  	numbers 1 thru $n$ and output the answer.
  \item Write a foreach loop to iterate over the elements (key/value pairs) 
	of the \mintinline{php}{$oneToTen} array.  As you iterate over the 
	elements you should sum the keys and concatenate the values to 
	formulate the following string (which you should output at the end 
	of the for-loop):
	
	\mintinline{text}{one + two + three + four + five + six + seven + eight + nine + ten = 55}
  \item Hand in your program using the webhandin and use the webgrader
    to verify your program works correctly.
\end{enumerate}
	
\subsection*{Child Tax Credit}

When filing for federal taxes, a credit is given to tax payers 
with dependent children according to the following rules.  The 
first dependent child younger than 18 is worth a \$1000.00 credit.  
Each dependent child younger than 18 after the first child is 
worth a \$500 tax credit each.  You will complete a PHP script 
to output a table of dependent children, how much each contributes 
to a tax credit, and a total child tax credit.  Your table should 
look something like the following.

\begin{minted}{text}
Child           Amount
Tommy (14)      $1000.00
Richard (12)    $500.00
Harold (21)     $0.00
Total Credit:   $1500.00
\end{minted}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Open the \mintinline{text}{Child.php} and 
  	\mintinline{text}{ChildCredit.php} script files
  \item The \mintinline{php}{Child} class has already been defined 
  	and included in the \mintinline{text}{ChildCredit.php} script.  
	Note how the \mintinline{php}{Child} class is used; several 
	instances of children have been created and placed into an array.
  \item Write code to iterate over the array, compute the child tax 
	credits and output a table similar to the one above.  Note: to 
	call a method on an instance of the \mintinline{php}{Child} class, 
	use the following syntax: \mintinline{php}{$kid->getAge()}
  \item Answer the questions in your worksheet and demonstrate your 
  	working code to a lab instructor.
\end{enumerate}
	
\subsection*{Advanced Activity (Optional)}
	
Modify the Child Tax Credit program to output the data in a 
well-formatted HTML table.  Demonstrate your dynamic webpage 
to a lab instructor.

\section*{Conditionals \& Loops}

Java provides standard control structures for conditionals and 
repetition.  Specifically, Java provides the usual if-then-else 
statements and while, for, and do-while loops.  The syntax for 
these control structures should look familiar; some examples:

\begin{minted}{java}
if(condition1) {
  //DO SOMETHING
} else if(condition2) {
  //DO SOMETHING ELSE
} else {
  //OTHERWISE
}

for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
  //DO SOMETHING
}

int i=0;
while(i<n) {
  //DO SOMETHING
  i++;
}

int i=0;
do{ 
  //DO SOMETHING
  i++;
} while(i<n);
\end{minted}

In addition, Java provides a foreach-loop, also referred to as an 
\emph{enhanced for-loop}, for iterating over collections (classes 
that implement the \mintinline{java}{Iterable} interface) or elements 
in an array.  This feature is mostly for convenience.  The following 
examples illustrate this loop's usage.

\begin{minted}{java}
String arr[] = new String[10];
...
for(String s : arr) {
  System.out.println(s); 
}
\end{minted}

  \item Write a foreach loop to iterate over the elements (key/value pairs) 
	of the \mintinline{java}{zeroToTen} array.  As you iterate over the 
	elements,concatenate each string, delimited by a single space to a 
	result string and print the result at the end of the loop.  Your 
	result should look something like the following:
	
	\mintinline{text}{zero + one + two + three + four + five + six + seven + eight + nine + ten = 55}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Advanced Activity (Optional)}

output of the Child Tax Credit program to print every piece of data 
in its own column.
